# Suicide Rates and GDP Analysis

## Introduction
This project investigates the relationship between GDP per capita ($) and suicide rates across different countries and years. The aim is to understand whether economic factors, specifically GDP per capita, have a significant impact on suicide rates.

## Problem Statement
The relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rates is analyzed to determine if higher economic wealth is associated with lower suicide rates. This study spans various countries and years, providing a comprehensive view of the correlation between these two variables.

## Findings
1. **Cluster Observation**: The number of suicides is significantly lower after $50,000 GDP per capita, forming a cluster of suicide rates between 0 and $50,000 GDP per capita.
2. **Covariance and Correlation**: 
   - Covariance: -918.1391961306477
   - Correlation Coefficient: -0.004563930815234864
   - These values suggest a weak negative linear relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rates.
3. **Scatter Plot and Linear Regression**: 
   - The scatter plot with the fitted line shows that the linear regression model does not fit the data well.
   - The model summary confirms that the coefficient of GDP per capita is not statistically significant.
   - The R-squared value is close to zero, indicating that the model explains very little of the variation in suicide rates.
4. **Conclusion**: Overall, the analysis suggests that there is no strong relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rates.
